/// describes a linear iterator that is based on a matrix operator
/**
 * This class is the base class for all linear iterators, that act on matrix
 * based linear operators. We call the matrix based iterator a 'Preconditioner'.
 * They are used in iterative schemes when solving a linear system.
 * Usually, a linear problem like L*u = f is intended to be solved. This is
 * done in an iterative way by performing an iteration of
 *
 * 	start: compute d := f - L*u
 * 	iterate: 	- 	c := B*d 		(compute correction)
 * 				-	u := u + c		(update solution)
 * 				- 	d := d - L*c	(update defect)
 *
 * This iterator class describes the application of B in the scheme above, where
 * L is internally represented by a matrix.
 *
 * This method derives from the ILinearIterator-interface and thus must
 * implement these to steps:
 *
 * 1. init(L, u) or init(L):
 * 		These methods initialize the iterator and one of these methods has to
 * 		be called before any of the apply methods can be used. Passing the
 * 		linear operator indicates that this operator is used as underlying
 * 		for the iterator.
 *
 * 2. apply or apply_return_defect:
 * 		These methods are used to compute the correction (and to update the
 * 		defect at the same time). Note, that these methods can only be called
 * 		when the iterator has been initialized.
 *
 * This splitting has been made, since initialization may be computationally
 * expansive. Thus, the user of this class has the choice when to call this
 * initialization. E.g. when the operator is applied several times the init of
 * the iterator is only needed once.
 *
 * In order to facilitate the implementation of derived classes a default
 * implementation of these virtual method is given. Thus, the implementational
 * part for a matrix based iterator is to implement the three functions:
 *
 * 1. preprocess: Initializes the preconditioner for a matrix, that is used as
 * 				  the underlying matrix. Calling these method again with a
 * 				  different matrix results in a different preconditioner.
 *
 * 2. step:	Computes the new correction.
 *
 * 3. postprocess:	Clean up (if needed)
