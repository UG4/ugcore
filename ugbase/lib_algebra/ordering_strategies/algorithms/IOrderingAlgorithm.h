	Interface for ordering algorithms. O_t denotes the ordering container type.
	Ordering algorithms have to implement
		compute() - triggers computation of an ordering
	as well as
		ordering() - returns a reference to an ordering of type O_t
	O_t usually is a std::vector<size_t>
	G_t (not required here) denotes the underlying graph type, e.g.,
                                                        a boost graph
