/// Gegenerated layer subset manager
/**
 * Class for the manager of the degenerated layer (e.g. fracture) subsets. Note
 * that the object of the class should get ALL the subsets that belong to ALL
 * the degenerated layers in the domain. This object gets updated every time
 * the grid is refined.
 *
 * Usage instructions:
 * <ul>
 *  <li> Create the object of the DegeneratedLayerManager class </li>
 *  <li> Use the method DegeneratedLayerManager::add to register a degenerated
 *       layer subsets in the object </li>
 *  <li> Call the DegeneratedLayerManager::close method to mark the vertices
 *       as 'inner' or 'outer'. </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Remarks:
 * <ul>
 *  <li> The grid must be created (loaded) before the object is created. </li>
 *  <li> All the degenerated layer subsets must be registered in the same degenerated
 *       layer manager. There should exist only one such the manager at all. Alternatively,
 *       the different managers must hold groups of the layers that are not intersect or
 *       connected to each other. But every degenerated subset must be registered
 *       in one of the degenerated layer managers. </li>
 * </ul>
