 * @brief Adjusts RM_FULL-selected quadrilaterals that cannot be fully refined.
 * 
 * In a multigrid with SHADOW-COPY elements (created, e.g., by anisotropic adaptive
 * refinement), it can happen that a surface quadrilateral with a SHADOW_COPY side
 * is marked for full refinement.
 * But that cannot take place because the SHADOW-COPY side is already copy-refined.
 * This can be solved if the element is marked RM_CLOSURE instead and its
 * SHADOW_COPY edge as well.
