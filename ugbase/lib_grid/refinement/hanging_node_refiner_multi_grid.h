/**	This class should be used, if hanging node refinement shall be
 * applied on a hierarchical grid (ug::MultiGrid).
 *
 * New elements will be constructed one level above their parent elements.
 *
 * HangingNodeRefiner_MultiGrid supports coarsening. Please note that coarsening
 * presumably has not yet reached its final implementation and behavior may
 * thus change in future revisions.
 * In the current implementation, refinement marks are removed during coarsening
 * and coarsening marks are removed during refinement. In order to use
 * coarsening and refinement on thus should first mark all elements which shall
 * be coarsened, perform coarsening, then mark all elements will shall be
 * refined and perform refinement (or vice versa).
 *
 * Take a look at ug::HangingNodeRefinerBase for a more in-depth documentation.
 *
 * \todo: 	Avoid the removal of refinement marks during coarsening and of
 * 			coarsening marks during refinement.
