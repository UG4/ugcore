/* Info File for 'ParticleTransfer' class: */

The 'ParticleTransfer' class imlements adapted interpolation operators for the application on cut elements due to immersed interfaces. It mainly performs a re-definition of the local weights due to the new geometry (which is in particular the edge lenght) of the cut element.

A detailed description of the re-definition of the weights can be found in [1].
