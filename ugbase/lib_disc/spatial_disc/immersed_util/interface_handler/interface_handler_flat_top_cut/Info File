/* Info File for 'InterfaceHandlerLocalParticle' class: */

In addition to the data provided by the base class, the 'InterfaceHandlerLocal' for the moving particle simulation needs to provide infomation on radial data: The discrete scheme for the angular momentum contains the cross product with the radial vector.

==> Most important new class members:

- std::vector<MathVector<dim> > m_vRadialAtIP;
- std::vector<MathVector<dim> > m_vRadialAtCo;
