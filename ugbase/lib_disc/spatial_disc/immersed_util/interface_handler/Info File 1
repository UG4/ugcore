/* Info File for 'InterfaceHandlerLocal' class: */

The 'InterfaceHandlerLocal' class acts as a link between the assembling process by the element discretisation 'ElemDisc' and the computations necessary for the immersed interface and by the CutElementHandler. As such, it inherits only local information on the current cut element, involved in the assembly process.

All assembling of the ElemDisc is cintered around the finite volume/element geometry object 'TFVGeom'. It inherits all local data, like corner coordinates, local indices, ReferenceObjectID. And from that it derives further local data (ip coordinates, normal vectors, gradients) and global data (global corner coordinates, global gradients, global ip coordinates).

On a cut element, the (finite volume/element) geometry of the element changes from its state in the original mesh. In particular, the coordinates of the corners change and can increase. With that, the cut element can change from a triangle/tetrahedron in the original grid to a quadrilateral/hexagon in the cut geometry (i.e. ReferenceObjectID changes).
Finally, for the local assembling procedures in UG4, due to the changed geometry, also the local indices of the corners need to be adapted and stored.



Main features:

- NEW LOCAL CORNERS on the cut element: It computes and inherits all coordinates of the cut element corners, i.e. original corners and intersections with the interface.
        Stored in: 'm_vCornerCoords'

- NEW LOCAL INDICES on the cut element: It computes and inherits necessary local index infos for the local assembly process (e.g. for the local-to-global-mapping).
        Stored in: 'm_vInterfaceID', 'm_vNOInterfaceID', 'm_vOriginalCornerID'

- NEW ReferenceObjectID: It inherits the (local) information regarding the ReferenceObjectID (ROID_TRIANGLE, ROID_QUADRILATERAL, ...)
        Stored in: 'm_roid'

- It has access to the cut element infos of the CutElementHandler, e.g. the 'ElementModus'.'



Important methods:
---> update_elem(): called by the 'geo.update()' method of the 'ElemDisc' class.
---> compute_cut_element_data(): calls CollectCorners_...()
---> CollectCorners_...()
---> set_roid_2d/3d()

Important data:
---> m_vCornerCoords: contains the new and old corners, already orderes appropriately!
---> m_vInterfaceID, m_vNOInterfaceID, v_OriginalCornerID: contains all infos on the local indices


Further remarks:

- The inner boundary faces, which form the linear approximation onto the immersed interface, are stored in the according derived class as 'm_vBF'. Since this object is derived from the finite volume/element geometry, it can not be initialized in the 'InterfaceHandlerLocalBase' class, which does not rely on this specific information.
