/**
 * The MessageHub provides a flexible way to register callbacks for a given
 * message-type, which can be called through the MessageHub::post_message method.
 *
 * Functions and member-functions of arbitrary classes can both be used as a
 * callback. Callback functions and methods have to have the following signature:
 *
 * void (*)(const TMsg&)
 *
 * where the message-type TMsg is derived from MessageHub::IMessage.
 * They can be registered through the register_callback methods.
 * If you're intending to register a member method of a class, then you have to use
 * additionally pass the pointer to the class instance, whose member-method shall
 * be called.
 *
 * On registration of a callback, an identifier is returned, which allows to
 * unregister the callback later on. The identifier is wrapped in a smart-pointer,
 * and supports an auto-free property. If this is property is enabled, then
 * the associated callback is automatically unregistered, as soon as the last
 * copy of the encapsulating smart-pointer is deleted.
